**Backend Software Engineer | AI Agent Developer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Backend Software Engineer, and I love developing software.

Most of my work is in the private repository of those guys who pay me to do what I love.
You'll find here some of the side projects I've built while fiddling with code.


### About Me
- **Expertise**: Developing backend systems and APIs, following the microservices (and sometimes monolith) architecture.
- **Tools**: **Java ,Spring/Spring Boot**, **Python ,FastAPI**, **Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js**, **SQL/NoSQL databases**  I also use cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **OpenShift Kubernetes**, LangChain
- **Current Role**: Backend Software Engineer, Integrations at Stanbic IBTC (a member of Standard Bank Group), where I contribute to building secure, scalable financial software solutions.
- **Background**: Started as a WordPress developer, managing digital marketing stacks, before transitioning to backend engineering and AI development.
- **Business Impact**: Built and managed APIs that: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Process Millions of Dollars in Monthly transactions<br>
